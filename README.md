# Typer ⌨️

This project is a typer, similar to [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/) or [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/). My intent was definitely not to create a better, or more flexible typing website, but it's rather a little toy project used to learn more about SvelteKit, and hopefully teach people a little bit about Bitcoin.

Feel free to report any bugs (I know the clock can be flaky at times) or feature request.
